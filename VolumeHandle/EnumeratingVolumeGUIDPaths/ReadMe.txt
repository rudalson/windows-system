The code example in this topic shows you how to obtain a volume GUID path for each local volume associated with a drive letter that is currently in use on the computer.
The code example uses the GetVolumeNameForVolumeMountPoint function.

For an example that enumerates all locally attached volumes and displays the device path, volume GUID path, and mounted paths (including drive letters), see Displaying Volume Paths.
